       <h1>Figure Skating</h1>
       
       <p>Every year for my birthday, I had my party at my uncles house because he had a huge pond and what else would you do for fun in the middle of winter! My birthday is January 21st while my brothers is January 28th! We always had combined birthday parties that involved activities such as sledding, eating, and ice skating! I fell in love with ice skating immediately and had the opportunity to take figure skating lessons at Bowdoin College when I was 14. Figure skating is still my favorite hobby EVER!</p>
